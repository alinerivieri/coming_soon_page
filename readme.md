# Coming Soon Page Using HTML CSS & JavaScript with Time Date Countdown

In this project was created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I added a time and date count using JavaScript, which will update every second. 

The counter will display the days, hours, minutes and seconds that are missing to launch the website.
